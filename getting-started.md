# Getting started

A couple of things to note about JAMstack before we dive in:
1. JAMstack is more of a terminlogy than a "stack"
2. Development and deployment are decoupled

## Development
However you decide to generate your HTML assets is up to you. The three most common approaches are:
1. Hand coding the HTML 
2. Generating HTML files 
3. Frontend framework 

### Hand coding
Simple and effective method of writing HTML, it's ideal for super simple pages. 
Examples:
- [trump-countdown](https://github.com/peduarte/trump-countdown)
- [fastgoodcheap](https://github.com/ibrennan/fastgoodcheap)

### Static Site Generators
Most JAMstack sites are powered by a static site generator. There's no enforcement on which SSG you decide to use.

Examples:
- Gatsby
- Next.js
- Hugo
- Eleventy
- Jekyll
- Middleman

### Frontend Framework
Most frameworks don't output static HTML files, however it is possible to do that but it requires more tooling experience and maintainance. 

Examples:
- React
- Vue
- Angular 2


## Dedployment

## Dynamic parts

## CMS

> note: mention that JAMstack is a front-end focus architecture
