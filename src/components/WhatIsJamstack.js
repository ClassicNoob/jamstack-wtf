          <SubSectionTitle>Javascript</SubSectionTitle>
          <SubSectionText>
            Dynamic functionalities are handled by Javascript. There is no
            restriction on which framework or library you must use.
          </SubSectionText>

          <SubSectionTitle>APIs</SubSectionTitle>
          <SubSectionText>
            Server side operations are abstracted into reusable APIs and
            accessed over HTTPS with Javascript. These can be third party
            services or your custom function.

          <SubSectionTitle>Markup</SubSectionTitle>
          <SubSectionText>
            Websites are served as static HTML files. These can be generated
            from source files, such as Markdown, using a Static Site Generator.

          <SubSectionTitle>Better developer experience</SubSectionTitle>
          <SubSectionText>
            Front end developers can focus on the front end, without being tied
            to a monolithic architecture. This usually means quicker and more
            focused development

          <SubSectionTitle>Scalability</SubSectionTitle>
          <SubSectionText>

          <SubSectionTitle>Content delivery network</SubSectionTitle>
          <SubSectionText>
            Since all the markup and assets are pre-built, they can be served
            via CDN. This provides better performance and easier scalibility.

          <SubSectionText>
            Each deploy is a full snapshot of the site. This helps guarantee a
            consistent version of the site globally.

          <SubSectionTitle>Cache invalidation</SubSectionTitle>
          <SubSectionText>
            Once your build is uploaded, the CDN invalidates its cache. This
            means that your new build is live in an instant.

          <SubSectionTitle>Automated builds</SubSectionTitle>
          <SubSectionText>
            Your server is notified when a new build is required, typically via
            webhooks. Server builds the project, updates the CDNs and the site
            is live.
