## What is JAMstack

### Meaning

JAM stands for Javascript, API & Markup. The term JAMstack was popularised by Mathias Biilmann (CEO & Co-founder of Netlify) to describe "a modern web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup".

Let's look a bit closer into what each of those pilars mean.

#### Javascript

Dynamic functionalities are handled by Javascript. There is no restriction on which framework or library you must use.

#### APIs

Server side operations are abstracted into reusable APIs and accessed over HTTPS with Javascript. These can be third party services or your custom function.

#### Markup

Web sites are served as static HTML files. These can be generated from source files, such as Markown, using a Static Site Generator.

### Best practices

#### Content Delivery Network

Since all the markup and assets are pre-built, they can be served via CDN. This provides better performance and easier scalibility.

#### Atomic deploys

Each deploy is a full snapshot of the site. This helps guarantee a consistent version of the site globally.

#### Cache invalidation
