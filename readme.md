## About

This project was put together by [@peduarte](https://twitter.com/peduarte) and presented at the [JAMstack meetup](https://www.meetup.com/JAMstack-London/events/257961818/) ([decks here](https://speakerdeck.com/peduarte/jamstack-cheatsheet)) in London.

The goal of this cheatsheet is to gather the concept of JAMstack in a straight-forward guide to encourage other developers to adopt the workflow.
